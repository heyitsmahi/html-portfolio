<h1>Some of my favourite Dramas</h1>
<h2>List of Korean Dramas</h2>

<h3>1. Boys Over Flowers</h3>
<p>
    This was my very first kdrama which was recommended by my friend during covid and it will always be my one of the all time favourite kdrama. Sonce I like romantic dramas mainly so I liked this very much. this is story about four famous young boys and
    a poor girl who got messed up with the boys but finally found her soulmate after a lot of struggles in which the main character's mother took a very big part(for troubleshooting them with problems). But all those struggles was worth it.

<h3>2. The Heirs </h3>

<h3>3. Vincenzo </h3>
<p> I thought that I like this kdrama mostly because of the mafia...(hehehehe) but I liked the plots very much. How the daughter didnt liked her father earlier. But after her father died a very inequity death She changed and tried her best to carry on the
    work her father left with the help of the russian mafia. Even the neighbours helped them and got together as a family and worked it out. Atlast they got justice and the devils paid for all of their wrong doings.
